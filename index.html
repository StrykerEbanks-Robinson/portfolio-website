            <p>My name's Stryker, and I'm a Software Engineer in-training! I'm from the Cayman Islands, but I'm currently living and working in Tampa, Florida, while I attend <a href='https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/' target='\_blank'>Thinkful's</a> immersive Software Engineering Coding Bootcamp.</p>

            <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
            <p>I graduated from the University of South Florida in 2019 with a bachelor's in Mathematics and World Languages & Cultures before my fianc&eacute;, Sarah, and I moved to Spain to work as North American Language & Culture Ambassadors in Spanish public schools for a year. After returning to Florida mid-pandemic, I rediscovered my love for coding and building programs, and I decided to start a new career journey into software engineering!</p>

        <h2 class='text-center'>Project Samples</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of projects that I've worked on! The first language that I learned was Python, so most of my finished projects were built using that. However, I'm currently also learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, so I hope to soon add some more finished projects to my repertoire in those languages, too!</p>

            <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe (AI)</h3>
            <p>This was one of the first projects that I completed. Using Python, I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against the computer or another human. If you pick the computer, you can also choose from three levels of difficulty, where Medium and Hard use a minimax algorithm so that the computer can play intelligently. Feel free to check out the code for my tic-tac-toe game on my <a href='https://github.com/StrykerEbanks/tic-tac-toe' target='\_blank'>GitHub</a>!</p>

            <h3 class='text-right'>Minesweeper</h3>
            <p>Since my fianc&eacute; really enjoys minesweeper, I built her a minesweeper game as one of my first Python projects. While the minimax algorithm in my tic-tac-toe project helped me to better understand recursive functions, this minesweeper project gave me a much firmer grasp of Python classes and the strengths of OOP. You can take a look under the hood of this project <a href='https://github.com/StrykerEbanks/minesweeper' target='\_blank'>here</a>!</p>
